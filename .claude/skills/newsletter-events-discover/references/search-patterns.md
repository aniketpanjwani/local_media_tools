## Advanced Search Operators

Use Google search operators for precision:

| Operator | Usage | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `site:` | Limit to domain | `Winnipeg venues site:instagram.com` |
| `"..."` | Exact phrase | `"Winnipeg music" events` |
| `-` | Exclude term | `Winnipeg events -hockey` |
| `OR` | Either term | `Winnipeg (venue OR bar) Instagram` |

## Region Codes

Use the `region` parameter for localized results:

| Country | Code |
|---------|------|
| Canada | `CA` |
| United States | `US` |
| United Kingdom | `GB` |
| Australia | `AU` |
| Germany | `DE` |
| France | `FR` |

## Recommended Search Strategy

1. **Start broad** (3-4 general queries)
   - `{city} events Instagram`
   - `{city} live music venues Instagram`
   - `{city} events site:facebook.com`

2. **Drill into categories** (2-3 specific queries)
   - Based on user's interests
   - Focus on underrepresented categories

3. **Neighborhood searches** (for large cities)
   - Target key entertainment districts

4. **Validate top candidates**
   - Check profiles for event-posting activity
   - Prioritize accounts with 1K+ followers

## Expected Results

| Query Type | Typical Results |
|------------|-----------------|
| General city + Instagram | 10-20 relevant accounts |
| Specific venue type | 5-10 focused accounts |
| Facebook events | 5-15 pages |
| Neighborhood search | 3-8 local spots |

## Cost Estimation

- Google Search: 1 credit per query
- Instagram Profile Validation: 1 credit per handle

For a new city, expect:
- 5-6 searches = 5-6 credits
- 15-20 validations = 15-20 credits
- **Total: ~20-25 credits**
